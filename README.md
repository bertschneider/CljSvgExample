# CljSvgExample

This little test project shows how to edit SVG graphics in
Clojure. The code is heavily inspired by Nakkaya's blog entry
[Visualizing Maps Using
Incanter](http://nakkaya.com/2010/03/09/visualizing-maps-using-incanter/).


## Usage

Import the ns to slime and run *view-rnd-color-germany* or *view-gdp-germany*.
